all the things i use to model mid and long term electricity consumption forcasting using deeplearning

Forecasting of power demand plays an essential role in the electric industry, as it provides the basis for making decisions in power system planning and operation.  A great variety of methods for predicting electricity demand are being used by electrical companies, which are applicable to short-term, medium-term or long-term forecasting.
